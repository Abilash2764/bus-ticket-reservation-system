This project is to implement a simple bus Ticket reservation System by using Arrays, Structures, Pointers, Functions and Text files 

User details along with the tickets booked are stored in a text file. The text file is then used to display the contents of old transaction records. The working of the project is explained below

Working: The program allows you to 
1)	Add new passenger record
2)	Search passenger record
3)	View passenger record

When the user enters the choice 1 it allows him/her to create a new record and let them book tickets by entering the following details: passenger ID, passenger Name, passenger mobile number ,passenger address ,number of passengers ,Passenger travelling time ,seat number of the passengers

When a user chooses option 2, he/she will be able to search for any previous records including all the details entered

Choise 3 allows the user view previous booking transactions, including all the details entered from text file

If the entered choise is 0 the program exits

Since there are three choices present in the menu, the program works if the choice input is either ‘1’, ‘2’ or ‘3’. Any other inputted value will display the menu again
